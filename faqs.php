        <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">What is COVID-19?</strong>
      Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are normally transmitted between animals and people. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has not been previously identified in humans. It was first reported to WHO on the 31st of December, 2019 in Wuhan, China.   </p>

        <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">What is the source of COVID-19?</strong>
      
Scientists and public health officials are working hard to identify the source of the SARS-CoV-2 which is the virus that causes COVID-19. The initial transmission appeared to be from an animal source, but there has been person-to-person transmission in countries.   </p>

        <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">Is COVID-19 airborne?</strong>
      
When a person with coronavirus coughs or exhales, droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch the virus by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch coronavirus if they breathe in these droplets. This is why it is important to stay at least 2 metres away from a person who is coughing or sneezing.   </p>

Yes. Nigeria has recorded confirmed cases of COVID-19. Most of the cases were imported from high risk countries with community transmission of COVID-19 while some are contacts of confirmed. Measures have been put in place to ensure all confirmed cases are isolated and receive treatment, while intense contact tracing is conducted.   </p>

        <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">What is Nigeria doing to control the spread of the disease in the country?</strong>
      



The Government of Nigeria has initiated a Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to provide high-level strategic national response to the disease in Nigeria. The Federal Ministry of Health has activated an NCDC-led national COVID-19 Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate response activities. At State-level, preparedness and response activities are being coordinated through Public Health EOCs in each State.

The Federal Ministry of Health is working closely with states and the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, to review response activities and to institute measures to protect the health of Nigerians. Recently, the Federal Government imposed a lockdown on the FCT, Lagos and Ogun States effective from the 30th of March for an initial period of time, to slow the spread of the disease in Nigeria.

The NCDC has also launched a campaign themed #TakeResponsibility. This is a call to all Nigerians and residents in the country to join forces and to be proactive in taking greater individual and collective responsibility in preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria   </p>

All return travellers to Nigeria in the last 14 days will be placed in institutional quarantine at a facility identified by the Federal Government of Nigeria. This is mandatory for all travelers to Nigeria. You will be tested if you develop symptoms during this time.   </p>

        <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">Should I travel to another state where there is no case of COVID-19 to stay safe?</strong>
      





No. There is a higher risk of spreading COVID-19 through movement and inter-state travel. All persons are advised to stay at home and avoid all non-essential movement and travel.   </p>

This means strictly staying at home or identified accommodation, away from situations where you mix with family members or the general public, for the period of 14 days. This means any situation where you may come in close contact with others (face to face contact closer than 2 metres i.e. 5 feet). The NCDC guidelines on this can be found HERE   </p>

This is an effective strategy to reduce physical interaction between people towards reducing the widespread of COVID-19 in a community. The NCDC guidelines on this can be foundHERE

This measure involves strict adherence to;

· Non-contact greetings (avoiding shaking of hands and hugs)

· Maintaining at least 2 metres (5 feet) physical distance between yourself and individuals

· Closure of activities that will cause any form of gathering including schools, houses of worship, and social events   </p>
